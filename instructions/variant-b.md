# Variant B Instructions

Please attempt to fix/implement the following in any order you choose.

- Clean up the browser console warnings
- The "Voting results" and "Candidates" links in the top-nav should change color
  depending on whether you are currently on that page
- The "VOTE PERCENTAGE" column should show the % of votes that candidate
  received in the round (it currently displays the total votes for that
  candidate in the round)
- Candidates should be ordered by the number of votes received in the round
- Navigating between rounds should leverage browser navigation (round persists
  in URL, rounds persist in native browser history navigation)
- Prevent the subtle shift in "Round X" text placement when clicking through
  the different rounds
- Write an appropriate jest test for the logic responsible for rendering
  candidate vote percentages

Please try not to spend more than 2-3 hours in total on this assignment. You are
not expected to complete all of the above steps but you should try to complete
as many as you are comfortable getting through in a reasonable amount of time.
If you have partial solutions to any of the above, feel free to leverage the
features of git and github to better isolate them for review.

You are encouraged to look up documentation, stack overflow posts, or any other
standard development resources while completing this assignment.
