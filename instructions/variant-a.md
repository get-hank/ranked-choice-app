# Variant A Instructions

Please attempt to fix/implement the following, in order. If you get stuck on
one, feel free to skip it and move to the next.

1. Clean up the browser console warnings
2. The "Voting results" and "Candidates" links in the top-nav should change
   color depending on whether you are currently on that page
3. The "VOTE PERCENTAGE" column should show the % of votes that candidate
   received in the round (it currently displays the total votes for that
   candidate in the round)
4. Candidates should be ordered by the number of votes received in the round
5. Round data should come from the API instead of the mock JSON
6. Navigating between rounds should leverage browser navigation (round persists
   in URL, rounds persist in native browser history navigation)
7. Prevent the subtle shift in "Round X" text placement when clicking through
   the different rounds
8. The election board is reporting different results than our API. They said
   something about data integrity issues in the vote file that require the
   elimination of certain ballots when tallying. Can you find the cause and fix
   this?

Please do not spend more than 2-3 hours in total on this assignment. You are
not expected to complete all of the above steps but you should try to complete
as many as you are comfortable getting through in a reasonable amount of time.
If you have partial solutions to any of the above, feel free to leverage the
features of git and github to better isolate them for review.

You are encouraged to look up documentation, stack overflow posts, or any other
standard development resources while completing this assignment.
